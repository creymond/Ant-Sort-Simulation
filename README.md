# Ant Sort Simulation
 
 Python ants sorting simulation.


## Description

One of the main source of AI algorithms come from observation of our world and its living entities. 
In particular, ants show interesting behavior as they can achieve great things when they work together,
even though as individuals they seem weak. This simulation relate the ability of ants to team up to achieve a task,
sorting items of different colors. In a resizable environment, ants move in any direction to find and sort 
items based on some probabilities and their memory of cases visited.
